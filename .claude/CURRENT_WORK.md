# Current work

One package at a time. This file is the only thing that changes between packages — `CLAUDE.md`
points here and never needs editing again.

Read this before writing code. Re-read the Purpose line whenever you have been fixing something
for more than an hour: if what you are fixing does not serve that line, stop and log it instead.

**Item:** #21 Mission Control Infrastructure V2
**Package:** T12 - Security and failure hardening

**Purpose (one sentence, plain words):**
Prove Runtime V2 stops injection, secret leakage, authority over-reach, exhausted budgets, unsafe
network destinations, path escapes, and untrusted tool metadata at the correct boundary.

**Not doing:**
- No live attack, remote request, credential use, dependency installation, or deployment.
- No second policy, path, terminal, network, Vault, or tool authority implementation.
- No weakening existing checks to make injections pass.
- No T13 UI, T14 rollout, or T15 adapter work.
- No Supabase, Vercel, external integration, or production-runtime interaction.

**Files expected:**
- `.claude/CURRENT_WORK.md`
- `docs/feature-idea-queue/MC_V2_BOARD.md`
- `docs/feature-idea-queue/MISSION_CONTROL_INFRASTRUCTURE_V2_PLAN.md`
- `docs/feature-idea-queue/QUEUE.md`
- `docs/feature-idea-queue/QUEUE_DELIVERY_LOG.md`
- `core/runtime/security.py`
- `docs/security/MC_V2_THREAT_MODEL.md`
- `tests/test_mc_runtime_security.py`
- accepted policy, tool, terminal, file, context, and evaluation regressions

**Gate: no**

## How the Gate line works

`scripts/gate.py` reads the line above and the fenced `gate` block, and runs on every stop.

| Value | Meaning | When to use it |
|---|---|---|
| `Gate: no` | Nothing is enforced. | Between packages, or during planning and discussion. |
| `Gate: red` | The checks **must fail**. Stopping is refused if they all pass. | Right after writing a new test, before implementing. |
| `Gate: green` | The checks **must pass**. Stopping is refused if any fail. | While implementing, until it is done. |

`red` is the step that matters. A test written after the code just agrees with the code. Running
it against the unchanged codebase and watching it fail is the only proof it tests anything.

Commands go one per line inside the fence, exactly as you would type them:

```
python -m compileall -q core api
python tests/test_runtime_contracts.py
```

Run it yourself at any time: `python scripts/gate.py`
